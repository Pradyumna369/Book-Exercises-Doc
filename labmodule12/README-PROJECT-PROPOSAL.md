# Lab Module 12 - Semester Project Proposal

## Description

The project idea is Home Environment Monitoring and Temperature Adjustment.It which aims at monitoring and maintaining the temperature and humidity in home at optimal comfortable levels.


## What - The Problem 

The project aims to solve the problem of uncomfortable home environments and high energy bills by automatically adjusting factors like temperature and humidity. By doing this, it makes homes more pleasant to live in while also helping people save money and reduce their energy usage. This is important because everyone wants to feel comfortable in their own home, and saving energy is good for the environment too.



## Why - Who Cares? 

Many people care about this, including homeowners who want to feel cozy at home, companies that build houses, and those who want to protect the environment. Making homes more comfortable and energy-efficient can improve people's quality of life and reduce their impact on the planet. Plus, it's a win-win situation because it saves money on energy bills as well.


## How - Expected Technical Approach

The project will utilize a constrained device application, gateway device application and cloud service. CDA will be responsible for monitoring temperature, humidity changes and triggering HVAC events. GDA will be receive data from CDA and sending actuation commands when the temperature and humidity levels falls outside predefined threshold limits. Cloud services will be used to store data and showing data in dashboard.



## Results - Expected Outcomes 

If everything works as planned, homes will become more comfortable, save energy, and contribute to a healthier environment. People will enjoy living in homes that automatically adjust to their needs, while also benefiting from lower energy bills. Ultimately, the success of this project could lead to more widespread adoption of smart home technologies, making life better for everyone.
